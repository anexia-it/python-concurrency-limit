python-concurrency-limit
========================

`python-concurrency-limit` is a library that implements a distributed concurrency limiting mechanism using Redis as a
backend. The library allows to limit the number of concurrent executions of code sections, either by waiting until
the currently running execution threads go below the limit, or by raising an exception if there are currently too many
execution threads. A combination of both strategies is also possible.
